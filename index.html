      <p>
        Don't ask me
        What you know is true
        Don't have to tell you
        I love your precious heart
        <br>
        I was standing
        You were there
        Two worlds collided
        And they could never tear us apart
        <br>
        We could live
        For a thousand years
        But if I hurt you
        I'd make wine from your tears
        <br>
        I told you
        That we could fly
        'Cause we all have wings
        But some of us don't know why
        <br>
        I was standing
        You were there
        Two worlds collided
        And they could never ever tear us apart
        <br>
        I was standing
        You wereâ€¦

      <strong>"Never Tear Us Apart" is a sensuous ballad, written in the tempo of a modern Viennese waltz, layered with synthesizers and containing dramatic pauses before the instrumental breaks.</strong>
